`sequence` is a very useful function that takes a `Traversable` (structure/collection) of `Applicative` (effect-ful) values and produces an `Applicative` of a `Traversable` of that value. So the signature (in Haskell) looks like

```haskell
sequence :: (Traversable t, Applicative f) => t (f a) -> f (t a)
```

According to the Haskell docs, it lets you

`sequence` is a useful function that lets you "evaluate each action in a structure from left to right, and collect the results" (according to the Haskell docs). A handy intuition for this I think if coming from JS, is that it's like a more general version of `Promise.all` (which lets you evaluate each `Promise` in an `Array` and collect the results as a `Promise` of an `Array`). Like

```typescript
Promise.all([Promise.resolve(1), Promise.resolve(2), Promise.resolve(3)]); //-> same as `Promise.resolve([1, 2, 3])`
```

In `fp-ts` land we can do the equivalent with

```typescript
RA.sequence(T.ApplicativePar)([T.of(1), T.of(2), T.of(3)]); //-> same as `T.of([1, 2, 3])`
```

`RA.sequence` is so common that there's usually a `sequenceArray` implemented in most modules (which is also more stack-safe, and sometimes more efficient), so you could replace `RA.sequence(T.ApplicativePar)` with just `T.sequenceArray`.

However `Array` is not the only `Traversable` structure/collection that you can do this trick with, and `Task` is not the only `Applicative` effect/action. I can also take a `Record` full of `Option`s and turn it into a `Option` of a `Record`

```typescript
RR.sequence(O.Applicative)({
  foo: O.some(1),
  bar: O.some(2)
}); //-> same as `O.some({ foo: 1, bar: 2 })`
```

In the case of

```typescript
RT.sequence(L.Applicative)([summaryForYearSpan(yearSpan), yearSpan]);
```

the `Traversable` structure is a _tuple_ (and the way the `Traversable` instance works here is just on the first position of the tuple), and the `Applicative` is for `Fold`. So given a `(Fold a, b)` tuple, I can get a `Fold (a, b)`.

That whole snippet is a bit of a hack just so I can thread the labels for each fold result through :smile:, I'm sure there's a simpler way of doing it. Alternatively you could also just do

```typescript
pipe(
  data,
  L.foldArray(
    L.struct({
      "2018-2019": summaryForYearSpan([2018, 2019]),
      "2018-2022": summaryForYearSpan([2018, 2022]),
      "2021-2022": summaryForYearSpan([2018, 2022])
    })
  )
);
```

What that means depends on the "action" and the "structure". "Action" corresponds to the choice of `Applicative` and "structure" corresponds to the choice of `Traversable` instance. In `fp-ts` we do

```typescript
{T}.sequence({F}.Applicative)({some collection T full of F<A>})
```

where `{T}` and `{F}` correspond to different modules in `fp-ts`. A handy intuition for

The "action" corresponds to
